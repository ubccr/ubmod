**NOTE**: UBMoD is no longer actively developed and we encourage you to
download [Open XDMoD][open-xdmod] as a replacement for UBMoD.
Open XDMoD has been developed to provide detailed information on
resource utilization and performance for academic and industrial HPC
centers.

UBMoD - Metrics on Demand
=========================

UBMoD is an open source data warehouse and web portal for mining
statistical data from resource managers (TORQUE, OpenPBS, Sun Grid
Engine and Slurm currently supported) commonly found in high-performance
computing environments. It was originally developed by Andrew Bruno at
the Center for Computational Research at the University at Buffalo,
SUNY.

If you find UBMoD useful and modify the default template we ask that you
please keep the "Powered By UBMoD" logo with a link back to CCR
(http://www.ccr.buffalo.edu).
